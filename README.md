## Development

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 2.7 or higher)
- Bundler
- Jekyll

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team.github.io.git
cd Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team.github.io
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

## Contributing

### Adding a Blog Post

Create a new file in `_posts/` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Your Post Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
image: '/images/posts/your-image.jpg'
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

Your content here...
```

### Adding a Publication

Edit `_pages/publications.md` and add a new publication card:

```html
<div class="publication-card">
<h3><a href="ARXIV_URL" target="_blank">Paper Title</a></h3>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Author 1, Author 2<br>
<details>
  <summary>View Abstract</summary>
  Abstract text here...
</details>
<strong><a href="ARXIV_URL">📄 Arxiv</a> | <a href="GITHUB_URL">💻 Code</a></strong><br>
<strong>Date:</strong> YYYY-MM-DD
</div>
```

### Adding a Video

Edit `_data/videos.yml`:

```yaml
- title: "Talk Title"
  speaker: "Speaker Name"
  youtube_id: "VIDEO_ID"
  youtube_url: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
  embed_url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  category: "Random Samples"
```

### Adding a Team Member

Edit `_pages/about.md` and add to the appropriate section (Team Members or Collaborators):

```html
<div class="col col-3 col-d-6 col-t-12">
  <div>
    <a href="/images/about/Headshots/name.jpg" class="portfolio__link glightbox"
       data-glightbox='title: Full Name; description: ; descPosition: bottom;'>
      <span class="portfolio__icon"><i class="ion ion-ios-eye"></i></span>
      <img src="/images/about/Headshots/name.jpg" data-src="/images/about/Headshots/name.jpg"
           class="portfolio__image lazy" alt="Picture of Full Name">
    </a>
